# Online-Examination-Portal
Online Examination Portal is a desktop application built using Java programming, enabling teachers to create and manage online exams, and students to take these exams within a specified time limit. The application uses the Microsoft Azure cloud database to store and manage exam data securely.

The application is divided into two parts: one for teachers and the other for students. On the teacher's part, teachers can create and manage exams by adding, deleting, and modifying questions. They can also set the time duration for the exam and configure the exam settings, such as the passing criteria, and total marks.

In the student part, students can log in to the application using their credentials and take exams assigned to them by their teachers. The exam interface shows one question at a time, and students have to answer it within a specified time limit. The application saves the answers automatically as the student progresses through the exam. At the end of the exam, the application calculates the marks based on the number of correct and incorrect answers.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for both teachers and students. Teachers can manage their exams and track the progress of their students. Students can take exams and view their results as soon as they complete them.

The Online Examination Portal is built using Java Swing framework for the user interface and Microsoft Azure cloud database for data storage. It provides a secure, reliable, and efficient platform for conducting online exams, which can be accessed from anywhere, at any time. The application is suitable for educational institutions, training centers, and other organizations that need to conduct online exams efficiently.
